## An Introduction

Since this is the first post to this blog, I'll start by getting everyone caught up.

**SpaceGame** is a prototype game I've been developing for a little over a month. While the primary goal of the project is the development of this game, a lot of the focus has been on the underlying engine that will eventually power it.

The engine itself doesn't have a formal name, but I'll be referring to it as `X` from this point forward since that is the namespace all of its code exists within. It's written in C++, uses DirectX 11 as its graphics API and in its current state is *Windows only*.

**Why develop a game engine from scratch instead of using an industry standard production engine like Unity or Unreal?** Because I feel like it.
